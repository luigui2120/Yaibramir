The service command manages installation and execution of ngrok as an
   operating system service on Windows, OS X and Linux systems.
   The service command takes a single argument which must be 'start', 'stop',
   'restart', 'install', or 'uninstall'.

   When you choose 'install', you must specify the config flag which will
   define where the installed ngrok service looks for its configuration file.

   When the ngrok service runs, it has the same behavior as if it were invoked
   from the command line with the command: "ngrok start --all".

EXAMPLE:
   ngrok service install -config=C:\ngrok.yml
   ngrok service start
   ngrok service stopStarts a tunnel which forwards all TCP traffic on a public port to a local
   address. This is extremely useful for exposing services that run non-HTTP
   traffic (ssh, sip, rdp, game servers, etc).

   A TCP tunnel binds a public address on the remote ngrok server. Any
   services which require a stable public address should use the
   --remote-addr option. ngrok.com requires that you reserve a TCP tunnel
   address for your account before you can use it.

EXAMPLES:
   # forward a port to your local ssh server
   ngrok tcp 22

   # expose an RDP server on a specific public address that you reserved
   ngrok tcp --remote-addr=1.tcp.ngrok.io:27210 3389The authtoken command modifies your configuration file to include
   the specified authtoken. By default, this configuration file is located
   at $HOME/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml

   The ngrok.com service requires that you sign up for an account to use
   many advanced service features. In order to associate your client with
   an account, it must pass a secret token to the ngrok.com service when it
   starts up. Instead of passing this authtoken on every invocation, you may
   use this command to save it into your configuration file so that your
   client always authenticates you properly.

EXAMPLE:
    ngrok authtoken BDZIXnhJt2HNWLXyQ5PM_qCaBq0W2sNFcCa0rfTZdUpdates ngrok to the latest version. This command checks the ngrok web
   service for a newer versions of the ngrok client. If a newer version is
   available, it will download it an replace the ngrok binary with the new
   version after cryptographically verifying the update is safe to apply.

   In order to update successfully, the ngrok binary must be in a directory
   that is writable by your current user. If you placed ngrok in a system
   path, you may need to run this with root or Administrator privileges.

EXAMPLES:
   ngrok update                    - update ngrok to the latest stable version
   ngrok update -channel=beta      - update ngrok to the latest beta versionã      ˇú‘Ωr≥8‡^W±Ωgg¡8q\l!Å aK,~;~a1,_pı;é'ªô/](u^öÁ=s˛º[Ñ˝°cüìËê„èW@	1¯¢ÎplîAA∏øD{}Y±•(T,˝‘['íkÜáÚHâUSoê∫ó Ù<K'Ã)¬T¨#∫˜÷ÊêEÈX¥O]¬qLQòU‘€pŒB÷•ÎÕ nﬁìy3Ÿ,ë`!Ç7õ¥)⁄ÜgQ˘NL.c¶¸‘îv9Ì0˘è,Â‡h~	c6$1[àAE`áó‹jjb¢9ã‘™xª

    ngrok exposes local networked services behinds NATs and firewalls to the
    public internet over a secure tunnel. Share local websites, build/test
    webhook consumers and self-host personal services.
    Detailed help for each command is available with 'ngrok help <command>'.
    Open http://localhost:4040 for ngrok's web interface to inspect traffic.

EXAMPLES:
    ngrok http 80                    # secure public URL for port 80 web server
    ngrok http -subdomain=baz 8080   # port 8080 available at baz.ngrok.io
    ngrok http foo.dev:80            # tunnel to host:port instead of localhost
    ngrok http https://localhost     # expose a local https server
    ngrok tcp 22                     # tunnel arbitrary TCP traffic to port 22
    ngrok tls -hostname=foo.com 443  # TLS traffic for foo.com to port 443
    ngrok start foo bar baz          # start tunnels from the configuration fileã      ˇå‘…Æ≥:=O—˚®ï	Xc¿ ;83O	!Ù≠s>©uı›A◊À*ÈoÀ˙U˝˜˚»H√÷ r)V1˝T9Ç±r§Çg¿¿åe¿∞.^»DÌÃHà	ÿi6h7ú…≤„¢‚\Å!3ÀÁdRP˚î∏dFN®¯éÉ—‹+aÈ£FZí¶Œâãg~z4◊St4ﬁÒ"î…a˜·¥ÑﬂI2 B˚’H£ŸXÔ‰&/…A⁄aÕ âÃﬂäˆD	gR‚Q¿b’›]°xœ≈[âÚˇ‚Ïï»$†“¿ﬁCrN†ÔìZÅ˚ÎFaeÂâV7…—ò‚ }8TÁW≥£è/†(&2˚	‚&M∫$áÁ§÷çwrtXx@3«*~ˇ(‡x XVf03Ü.†√2p ü∏Œ˙ı∞Op©ﬂ¥ÜÙa‹…ﬂ˘Yâà¶Ö5?HßC„+Iˇ4É/Œ—U%*(§œı∞Û€∫¢vÚäØY≠mìqY[¥π,≤”#ÈVãbz+˜o<≥yIß<Kx-%ÌÆv¸I—ÖøZU·æm'›ﬂ“•´.úú]JÊáæ¥l ∏?Õ–i;%Òw±™À&oÒŒ›ÂaÊÏ¸4”ñ&u8Á—ÔI`“3WNòË„‚Z⁄»∂&∑æQ«ó⁄•tÃøñN5ó≥Èˆ/˝TZï$+P7çC_£”˙d$Ô]n´ô{®≈Cﬂ_íΩªo§wmÚ∑Htª?£≤L˘Gî∂rh«[ü≠Ì˘	vâ˙îHŒFd ¥í%ﬁÃ<Îﬂ››UñC§ÍÔ9É◊ñﬂ\å)\˜‚r”Dò∆ß⁄¨¡ ˙ç†lï&ªgQgeø±ã"iàÙ U˛m0Mπ=®AØ:âå˚'eˇ˜˜ 4Xkÿñ'^—†»wòÓ$S† Gﬂ~‰~’oÅ¿ÅcV‰mø5Gä÷ú+uU„©G˙vàääí\˚¶Áù·Áz~ò¥∞Û{‰ØΩ—ùáw’Ç`§◊≤ß˜†AFZnå¥sj}Ëî≈í¨u/±âœ7Nb≠5‚S∏"f≈õı*bÂ‡ëPn∑Sîk◊Œ≤ÀuCÁãˆŒ≤U˙–*ªxæÈZá:3Áÿ&4À]’x<	L•O]ÜèÜW˜~&T”—h+;àK;<:ò≈¨ø0˘˛K Ç1rìÒÃ˚¢⁄laÒÛ¬V¨≠8´8jΩˆ”çÚn¿/ΩKø∂Ã¸òÓ¥rè;©`{À%ê[ÄÌüƒLTlÎà”∏Å6:=/€|)Ùû%Z4>Ó˘âm∏ü5ä,Âœ´ı  ˇˇ0zÊÉw  Starts a tunnel listening for TLS traffic on port 443
   with a specific hostname. The TLS SNI (Server Name Indication)
   extension field in the TLS connection is inspected to determine
   which tunnel it matches.

   The ngrok server does not terminate TLS connections forwarded with this
   command. Any underlying protocol may be used. You may optionally specify a
   TLS key/cert pair which will be used to terminate the traffic client-side
   before it is forwarded. If not specified, the traffic will be forwarded
   still encrypted.

   Using this command is only recommended with the -hostname option. Other uses
   will work, but will always result in certificate mismatch warnings.

EXAMPLES:
   # forward TLS traffic for example.com to port 443 (requires CNAME)
   ngrok tls -hostname=example.com 443

   # forward TLS traffic on subdomain (mismatch certificate warning)
   ngrok tls 1234

   # terminate TLS traffic for t.co before forwarding
   ngrok tls -hostname=t.co -crt=/path/to/t.co.crt -key=/path/to/t.co.key 443Starts a tunnel listening for HTTP/HTTPS traffic with a specific hostname.
   The HTTP Host header on incoming public requests is inspected to
   determine which tunnel it matches.

   HTTPS endpoints terminate TLS traffic at the ngrok server using the
   ngrok.io certificates. The decrypted, HTTP traffic is then forwarded
   through the secure tunnel and then to your local server. If you don't want
   your TLS traffic to terminate at the ngrok server, use a TLS or TCP tunnel.

EXAMPLES:
   ngrok http 8080                      # forward ngrok.io subdomain to port 80
   ngrok http example.com:9000          # forward traffic to example.com:9000
   ngrok http -subdomain=bar 80         # request subdomain name: 'bar.ngrok.io'
   ngrok http -hostname=ex.com 1234     # request tunnel 'ex.com' (DNS CNAME)
   ngrok http -auth='falken:joshua' 80  # enforce basic auth on tunnel endpoint
   ngrok http -host-header=ex.com 80    # rewrite the Host header to 'ex.com'
   ngrok http file:///var/log           # serve local files in /var/log
   ngrok http https://localhost:8443    # forward to a local https serverã      ˇÑV—é€∫}ÔW(É"cöÚ&EokôæHrÛP†-$@°†…ëƒ]äT(⁄é„’øíÏ]o˜¢}1»ô·93á£°7MlÌˆIí$õ•ûó”6öhqÎÍ‡6ŸºyrûœIêÆ∆‰èi˜ò¨E¬ø∆ì≈>Ügk‹CO
